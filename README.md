# DEPRECATED: Dart wrapper library for the new Firebase

This library is now **deprecated** and moved to the official [firebase](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/firebase).

Please update your `pubspec.yaml` file to `firebase` dependency, do the `pub get`, update imports to `firebase` library and you are ready to go:

```
dependencies:
  firebase: any
```
