# DEPRECATED: Dart wrapper library for the new Firebase

This library is now **deprecated** and moved to the official [firebase-dart](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-dart/).

Please update your `pubspec.yaml` file to `firebase` dependency, do the `pub get` and you are ready to go:

```
dependencies:
  firebase: any
```
